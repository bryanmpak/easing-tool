# easing-tool

assignment: a chrome easing tool using vue.js

## high-level commentary

1. avoided using external libraries
2. per previous convo, i'm more adept with react so i built this in react first, then rebuilt in vue. please excuse any vuejs nuances i have yet to pick up 🙏 both work fine, but if evaluating code, feel free to also take a look at the react code!
3. referenced an existing repo for bezier curve maths (github.com/gre/bezier-easing), assumed math would not be part of this exercise 😅
4. this repo followed the requested output, but added a few extras in the react-based repo (keyboard accessibility, input fields, etc) for fun!
