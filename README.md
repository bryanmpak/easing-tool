# easing-tool

assignment: a chrome easing tool using vue.js

## high-level commentary

1. avoided using external libraries
2. per previous convo, i'm more adept with react so i built the scaffolding in react first, then rebuilt in vue. please excuse any vuejs nuances i have yet to pick up 🙏 both work fine, but if evaluating code, feel free to also take a look at the react code (https://github.com/bryanmpak/bezier-editor)!

3. referenced an existing repo for bezier curve maths (https://github.com/gre/bezier-easing), assumed math would not be part of this exercise 😅
